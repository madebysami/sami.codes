        Hi, I'm <strong>Sami Bashraheel</strong>. I build websites, apps, and
        tools that make life a little easier or more interesting.
      </p>

      <p>
        I enjoy working on projects that are useful, fun, or both. Sometimes
        that means making a tool for other developers, sometimes it's a game,
        and sometimes it's just something I want to see exist.
      </p>

      <p>
        I care about making things fast, accessible, and pleasant to use. I like
        clean code, clear interfaces, and sites that feel good on any device.
      </p>

      <h2>What I use</h2>

      <p>
        My main stack is <strong>Astro</strong>, <strong>React</strong>, <strong
          >TypeScript</strong
        >, and <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> for the web. I use <strong
          >Python</strong
        > for data and automation. I try new tools often, but I stick with what works.
      </p>

      <h2>Elsewhere</h2>

      <p>
        You can find me online, sharing code, writing about what I'm learning,
        or just chatting. If you want to say hi or work together, feel free to
        reach out:
