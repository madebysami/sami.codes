        I'm <strong>Sami Bashraheel</strong>, a Web & AI Developer. I build
        digital products and experiments using modern web technologies and
        Artificial Intelligence.
      </p>

      <p>
        I design, develop, and ship products that solve real problems — from
        interactive learning tools to developer utilities and beyond.
      </p>

      <p>
        I believe great software should be fast, accessible, and beautifully
        crafted. Every project I build targets <strong
          >100/100 Lighthouse scores</strong
        > and <strong>WCAG 2.1 AA</strong> accessibility as a minimum. Performance
        isn't a nice-to-have — it's a requirement.
      </p>

      <h2>How I work</h2>

      <p>
        I work in public. I document what I learn, share what I build, and write
        about the decisions behind the code. If you're following along, you'll
        see the real process — not just the polished result.
      </p>

      <p>
        My current tech stack centres on <strong>Astro</strong>, <strong
          >React</strong
        >, <strong>TypeScript</strong>, and <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> for the
        web, with <strong>Python</strong> for AI and data work. I'm always learning.
      </p>

      <h2>Get in touch</h2>

      <p>
        I'm always open to interesting conversations, collaborations, or just a
        friendly hello. Find me on the usual platforms:
