Hi, I'm Sami. 👋

I'm a developer who likes building things for the web. This blog is where I keep track of what I'm learning, share the projects I make, and write down my thoughts along the way.

## What I'm working on

Right now I'm building a few different projects, mostly web apps and interactive tools. I usually reach for **Astro**, **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. I handle everything from the initial idea to the final code.

## Why I'm writing

I think it's helpful to build things out in the open. Writing forces me to think clearly about my code. It's a great way to meet people and document my progress for anyone else trying to learn the same stuff.

Whether you write code for a living or you're just curious about how things work on the internet, stick around. Let's build something together.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/sami), [X](https://x.com/madebysami), and [dev.to](https://dev.to/sami).
