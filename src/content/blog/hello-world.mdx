Hi, I'm Sami. 👋

I'm a Web & AI Developer building digital products and experiments with modern web technologies. This blog is where I document what I learn, what I build, and what I think about along the way.

## What I'm working on

I'm currently building a series of projects — from calculator tools to interactive experiences — using **Astro**, **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. Every project is designed, built, and shipped by me.

## Why I'm writing

I believe in building in public. Writing forces clarity, sharing creates opportunities, and documenting the journey helps others who are a few steps behind.

If you're a developer or just someone curious about how things are built — welcome. Let's build something together.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/sami), [X](https://x.com/madebysami), and [dev.to](https://dev.to/sami).
